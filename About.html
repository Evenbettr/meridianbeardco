  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Beard care should be clean, transparent, and functional — not complicated.</p>

Meridian Beard Co. uses a base of organic, plant-derived oils selected for skin compatibility, absorption, and long-term use. We avoid fillers, harsh synthetics, and ingredients added solely for label appeal.

<P>Our approach:<P>

<P>Organic carrier oils  - jojoba, argan, apricot kernel, hemp seed, mango seed, and vitamin E

Essential oils used with restraint, not as perfume</P>

<P>No artificial fragrance blends

No unnecessary preservatives or thickeners / What's on the label is what's in the bottle</P>

Every formula is designed to support the skin beneath the beard as much as the beard itself.

<P>If an ingredient exists only to sound impressive, we leave it out.
If it improves performance, stability, or comfort, we keep it.</P>

<P>Clean doesn’t have to mean delicate.
It just means intentional.</p>

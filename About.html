  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Beard care should be clean, transparent, and functional — not complicated.

Meridian Beard Co. uses a base of organic, plant-derived oils selected for skin compatibility, absorption, and long-term use. We avoid fillers, harsh synthetics, and ingredients added solely for label appeal.

Our approach:

Organic carrier oils  - jojoba, argan, apricot kernel, hemp seed, mango seed, and vitamin E

Essential oils used with restraint, not as perfume

No artificial fragrance blends

No unnecessary preservatives or thickeners / What's on the label is what's in the bottle

Every formula is designed to support the skin beneath the beard as much as the beard itself.

If an ingredient exists only to sound impressive, we leave it out.
If it improves performance, stability, or comfort, we keep it.

Clean doesn’t have to mean delicate.
It just means intentional.</p>
